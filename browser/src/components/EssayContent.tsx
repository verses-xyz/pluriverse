          e are told that the age of the Metaverse is upon us.{" "}
        </span>
        The Metaverse, led by Meta, allows and celebrates <b>monopoly</b>,
        gating access to the length and breadth of the digital ecosystem. The
        monopolies of the Metaverse take what was once collective and ensure it
        is bought, sold, measured, and speculated upon. The Metaverse expands as
        a homogenizing <b>monoculture</b>, assimilating ecosystems, displacing
        extant species, and enclosing digital abundance into enforced scarcity.
        A new-age Columbus of digits and pixels, Meta purports to chart new
        territory while simply recycling the harms and stagnation of the old.
        The Metaverse we are promised is not a gift we should accept, but a
        shackles in disguise. This is an empty land grab for the commons of the
        future and the resources of the past. This is no Metaverse, this is a{" "}
        <b>monoverse</b>.

        But we have brighter dreams, of brighter technological futures. Futures
        that are rooted in history, that prefigure infinite gardens of
        collective wisdom, intelligence, and collaboration. Futures where we
        move past promises of mere “freedom from” towards the shared capacity
        for building “freedoms to”. Futures of <b> polycentrism</b>, where
        resources are owned and governed by the many, and where false scarcity
        again gives way to the creation of common spaces, collectively-owned
        public infrastructure, and shared, self-sovereign worlds. Spaces of
        <b> plurality</b>, where choice is meaningful because difference is
        prized; all the better to create a resilient ecology of diverse
        co-existence. We propose these dreams and futures be gathered under a
        different banner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Together, we can steward these new futures; we invite you to dream,
        collaborate, and strategize towards a different world. We propose to
        gather these worlds around a different banner: the

        Origins of the Pluriverse
      </h2>
      <p>
        The origin of the term ‘pluriverse’ is itself plural. The word has its
        roots in decolonial theory, emerging from the Zapatista movement and
        taken forward by activists and academics alike, championed especially by
        the cultural anthropologist Arturo Escobar and the literary critic and
        theorist Walter Mignolo. The pursuit of pluriversality is{" "}
        <b>the embrace of a world in which many worlds may fit</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of top-down, it’s bottom-up. Instead of one-size-fits-all, it’s
        a diverse ecology. Instead of monoculture its pluriculture. Slowly,
        subtley, insidiously, our internet - and by extension one might argue,
        our minds - is being colonised by a single vision of what is possible.
        The territory is digital, but the risk of a world where only one world
        fits is real, and so we call for a rewilding - a reinvigorating, a
        return of vitality, to the intimate spaces we connect, explore and think
        in. Our digital commons is not for sale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The history of the term is an oppositional one - it was birthed in
        response to the single, globalized Western system of being, a
        never-ending juggernaut of assimilation and monopoly over society
        itself. Those organizing under the term ‘pluriverse’ aimed to counter
        the universal - not with a disregard of all things universal, but with
        an embrace of ‘many universals’. We can see this not as a movement
        entirely away from the necessity of scale, but one that embraces
        federation and subsidiarity as well as one that requires many worlds to
        exist ‘at scale’ - pluricultures, not monocultures. Thus, the pluriverse
        arrays itself <i>against</i> universality as much as it is <i>for</i>{" "}
        plurality and epistemic diversity. It is for this reason that we believe
        it can act as an appropriate foundation for a socio-digital ecosystem -
        one that must both oppose / critique and create / imagine.

        Escobar highlights the <i>decentering</i> necessary as a precursor to
        pluriversality. The neoliberal expansion of the 1990s centered a
        homogenous form of social organization as the driver of global
        capitalism, displacing other forms of being, knowing, and producing. To
        Escobar, aiming for post-capitalism or post-development does not mean
        immediately aiming for these constructs to cease to exist. Instead, he
        advocates for a displacement of their centrality, to make way for a
        mosaic of communal, alternative, and autonomous cultural and economic
        worlds. This can expand the partial common ground and surface area of
        contact between these multiplicities, leading to a world of difference,
        but not disconnection. It is this ethos towards which we hope to bring
        the digital pluriverse.
